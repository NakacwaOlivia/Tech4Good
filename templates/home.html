            <p class="card-text">
              Chalky soils contain a high amount of calcium carbonate, making
              them high-alkaline soils. Chalky soil has a fine soil texture that
              dries out easily. Plants that require acidic soil will not survive
              in chalky soil. In some cases, chalky soil can be acidified but
              more often than not, gardeners are better off only using plants
              that tolerate alkaline soils.

              They are dense, high in nutrients, and contain more than
              twenty-five percent clay particles. Clay soil particles are small
              and tightly packed together with very little airspace between
              particles. They retain a high amount of water but offer poor
              drainage. The size of the particles makes it difficult for plant
              roots to take hold and can prove to be a challenge.

              soils are high in nutrients, have good water retention, and have
              good drainage. It is one of the best agricultural soils and is
              ideal for use in a raised garden bed.

              way of nutrients and water retention, which can hinder plant
              growth. The addition of organic matter can improve the soil
              structure, providing plant roots with more nutrients and water.

<h4>MAIN CAUSES OF SOIL INFERTILITY</h4>
<div class="row justify-content-evenly cause gx-0">
  <div class="col-md-3 mt-4">
    <h5>Acidity levels</h5>
    <p>
      Plants grow because they feed off of the nutrients that they receive from
      the soil. The acidity level of the soil has a direct impact on the ability
      of plants to absorb these nutrients. As the acidity level of the soil
      rises, the amount of energy required by plants to absorb key nutrients
      increases, making it more difficult for the plants to absorb them. When
      soil is too acidic, plants cannot absorb the nutrients they need, thus
      rendering the soil infertile and unable to produce growth.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3 mt-4">
    <h5>Nutritional Composition</h5>
    <p>
      The nutritional composition of your soil also has a direct impact on its
      fertility. Plants use three basic elements from the soil to grow. These
      elements are nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. If your soil lacks the
      appropriate balance of these elements, plants will not have enough
      nutrients to grow, resulting in soil infertility. Plants also require
      iron, zinc, magnesium, and some other elements for growth, so it’s also
      important that your soil has the correct amounts of these nutrients.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3 mt-4">
    <h5>Poor Soil Structure</h5>
    <p>
      The way your soil is made up can affect how plant roots access the water
      and oxygen needed to draw out nutrients from the soil. The structure of
      the soil impacts how much water and oxygen are available for plant roots.
      If your soil is made up of large particles, this provides enough room for
      oxygen but results in the over-drainage of water. On the other hand, if
      your soil is made up of smaller particles, this prevents water from
      draining and oxygen from flowing. Finding the right balance is key.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-evenly cause gx-0">
  <div class="col-md-3 mt-4">
    <h5>Salinity and Sodicity</h5>
    <p>
      If there are high levels of salt in your soil, this will prevent plants
      and grass from absorbing water. This will also eventually ruin the
      physical structure of your soil. Soil with high salinity levels is often
      found in areas with natural salt deposits. Using certain chemicals and
      synthetic fertilizers have also been shown to increase soil salinity,
      causing the soil to become infertile.Sodic soils occur when there is too
      much sodium in the soil itself. These soils will often have decreased
      levels of calcium and magnesium, increased pH levels between 8.5 and 10.0
      and degraded soil structure.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3 mt-4">
    <h5>Soil PH Levels</h5>
    <p>
      Soil fertility problems may also occur when the soil pH is outside the
      ideal range for plant growth. Most plants can grow when the soil pH is
      between 5.5 and 7.0. Some plants, such as azaleas and blueberries, will do
      well in more acidic soils with a pH under 5.5. Acidic soils affect soil
      fertility by decreasing the availability of critical nutrients, such as
      magnesium, calcium and potassium, while increasing the availability of
      elements that can become toxic in large amounts, such as iron, zinc and
      aluminum. Correct acidic soil by adding lime and mixing it into the soil
      in the amount recommended by your soil test results.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3 mt-4">
    <h5>Soil Erosion</h5>
    <p>
      Erosion is another of the factors affecting soil fertility. This is a
      common concern, especially when you are growing crops on a slope, notes
      Iowa State University Extension and Outreach. As the topsoil erodes, the
      soil nutrients decrease, and soil quality and structure decline. The soil
      is also limited in its ability to hold water. With limited topsoil, plants
      reach down into the subsoil. In many cases, the subsoil is inhospitable to
      plant roots. Coarse subsoil that consists of gravel and sand particles
      will not hold enough water to support the plants. Subsoil that has fine
      particles prevents water drainage and limits oxygen availability to the
      roots.
